# Efficient Distributed Training Scheduler

A Go-based system for optimizing multi-GPU ML training workload distribution with low-latency RPC communication.

## Project Overview

This project implements a distributed training scheduler that efficiently manages machine learning workloads across multiple GPUs. The system consists of:

1. **Scheduler Server**: Coordinates tasks and manages resource allocation
2. **Worker Clients**: Execute training tasks on GPU-equipped nodes
3. **RPC Communication**: Enables low-latency message passing between components

## Architecture

The system is designed with the following key components:

- **Scheduler**: Central coordinator that distributes workloads based on resource availability and optimization algorithms
- **Worker**: Client that runs on nodes with GPUs, executing assigned training tasks
- **Task**: Representation of a training job with specific resource requirements
- **Resource Manager**: Tracks available GPU resources across the cluster
- **Workload Optimizer**: Implements algorithms to efficiently distribute tasks

## Features

- Efficient workload distribution across multiple GPUs
- Low-latency RPC communication
- Fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms
- Real-time monitoring of training progress
- Dynamic resource allocation based on workload demands

## Implementation

The system is implemented in Go, leveraging its concurrency model and performance characteristics for efficient distributed computing.
